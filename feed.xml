They were published in 1915, 1931 and 1938. Details of these editions, including the manuscripts Ācārya used, were published in <a class="citation" href="#wuja-2006">(Wujastyk, 2006, chap. 3)</a>.</p> <p>The Suśruta Project has been using an etext transcription of the 1938 edition, typed and generously made public by Tsutomu Yamashita and Yasutaka Muroya in 2014. Because of the limited availability of text editions in Japan at the time, this etext used the 1931 edition for the sūtrasthāna and śārīrasthāna parts of the text. The Suśruta Project 2.0 is currently inputting these parts from the 1938 edition, so that the etext will represent the 1938 edition in a unified way.</p> <p>A side-effect of this work means that we are gaining the possibility of comparing the changes that Ācārya made between his 1931 and 1938 editions. As an example, <a href="https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/03-su.sa/03-za-vulgate-1931?upama_ver=i4l46viq17">here is the 1931 edition of the <em>Compendium</em> with the apparatus showing the changes that Ācārya made for his 1938 edition</a>.</p> <h2 id="when-should-i-get-married">When should I get married?</h2> <p>If you scroll to passage 10.53 in the śārīrasthāna, where the care of children is being described, you will find a statement advising a young man of 25 years about whom to marry. In the 1931 edition, the passage reads :</p> <blockquote> <p>अथास्मै पञ्चविंशतिवर्षाय द्वादशवर्षां पत्नीमावहेत्पित्र्यधर्मार्थकामप्रजाः प्राप्स्यतीति॥</p> <p>Then, a man of twenty-five should take a wife of twelve so that he may obtain children for the sake of ancestral duty, wealth, and pleasure.</p> <p>— Suśrutasaṃhitā Śārīrasthāna 10.53 <a class="citation" href="#susr-1931">(Ācārya, 1931, p. 337)</a></p> </blockquote> <p>But in the 1938 edition, Ācārya emended the passage to read “a wife of sixteen.” Viewed as an important social injunction, this is a major change.</p> <p>In his footnote on this change <a class="citation" href="#susr-1938">(Ācārya &amp; Ācārya, 1938, p. 392)</a>, Ācārya noted that on this point he was adopting the reading of the “palm leaf manuscript” (<em>ṣoḍaśavarṣāṃ iti tā. pustake paṭhyate)</em> and that the other manuscripts he examined read “twelve-year-old” (<em>itītareṣu hastalikhitapustakeṣu</em>). The palm leaf manuscript he refers to is MS Kathmandu NAK 5-333 (siglum H), and it does indeed read <em>ṣoḍaśavarṣām</em> (scribal folio 197r, line 2, image dscn3174 fol196.jpg ).</p> <p>(As a footnote to a footnote, Ācārya made a typo in his 1938 edition: he printed <em>ṣoḍaṣadaśavarṣāṃ</em>; that this was just a typo is proven by his footnote, where he says “ṣoḍaśavarṣāṃ” <a class="citation" href="#susr-1938">(Ācārya &amp; Ācārya, 1938, p. 392)</a>.)</p> <p>Thus we see that the small details of philology and textual criticism can make a large difference to the meaning of a text that - even today - has real social influence.</p> <h3 id="references">References</h3> <ul> <li>Ācārya, Yādavaśarman Trivikrama, ed. 1931. <em>सुश्रुतसंहिता, सुश्रुतेन विरचिता, वैद्यवरश्रीडल्हणाचार्यविरचितया निबन्धसंग्रहाख्यव्याख्यया समुल्लसिता, आचार्योपाह्वेन त्रिविक्रमात्मजेन यादवशर्मणा संशोधिता</em>. 2nd ed.

Currently (August 2025), we have manuscripts from Bikaner, Calcutta, Cambridge, Chandigarh, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jamnagar, Jodhpur, Kathmandu, Kurukshetra, Lahore, London, Lucknow and Pune. We don’t have <em>all</em> the manuscripts from each of these places, and all the manuscripts are partial. But the archive is growing.</p> <p>We need to develop techniques for triaging these manuscripts. That is to say, we are aware of a major cleavage in the history of transmission of the SS, between the Nepalese version and the vulgate. So when we look at a new manuscript, we want to have a rapid way of detecting whether it belongs to one or other of these transmissions, or to another transmission that is different from either.</p> <p>At first, I thought the absence of the “<em>yathovāca bhagavān dhanvantariḥ</em>” phrase would be a marker of the Nepalese version. But this is not the case. Manuscripts without this phrase still have vulgate readings. That suggests that the Dhanvantari phrase was added after the vulgate branch had already separated from the Nepalese transmission. We need to look more deeply.</p> <p>Therefore we want to develop a series of cruxes, that is to say bold, clear diagnostic differences between the Nepalese and the vulgate transmissions. We want to gather a list of these cruxes covering each sthāna, and perhaps several adhyāyas. This blog post will gather such passages.</p> <h2 id="list-of-cruxes">List of cruxes</h2> <p>Sūtrasthāna, adhyāyas 45 and 46 have many verses in the vulgate that do not appear in the Nepalese version, and vice versa. Cruxes in other sthānas too are listed below. Some of the more obvious differences are as follow. This is not an exhaustive list of such differences, just some of the longer, very clear cruxes where large numbers of passages differ.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>vulgate numbering</th> <th>in vulgate</th> <th>in Nepalese</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1.10.4 (ity eke … na samyak phrase)</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.13-16</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>after 1.45.40 4 verses</td> <td>N</td> <td>Y</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.31-42</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.66-83</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.85-88</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.97-107</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.116–119</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.124-130</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.133-142</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.145-147</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.149-155</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.45.175-181</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.46.210, the following 15 verses</td> <td>N</td> <td>Y</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.46.250-256</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.46.282-288</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.46.297-312</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.46.326-330</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>1.46.522-</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>3.2.10.add1-add11</td> <td>N</td> <td>Y</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3.2.30</td> <td> </td> <td>MS H has a saut du même au même</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3.2.29-31</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3.2.35.1 - 3.2.35.4</td> <td>N</td> <td>Y</td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>5.1.5cd-6ab (viṣakanyā)</td> <td>Y</td> <td>N</td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table>]]></content><author><name>Dominik Wujastyk</name></author><category term="Suśruta"/><category term="manuscripts"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[cruxes]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Acquiring manuscript images</title><link href="https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/website/blog/2025/acquiring-manuscript-images/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Acquiring manuscript images"/><published>2025-06-27T07:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-27T07:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/website/blog/2025/acquiring-manuscript-images</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://sushrutaproject2.github.io/website/blog/2025/acquiring-manuscript-images/"><![CDATA[<p>Work has begun in earnest on the task of collecting more digital copies of manuscripts of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>.

The title of the chapter is interesting: “how to enter the roadway,” (विशिखानुप्रवेशनीयमध्यायम्). Commentators and dictionaries interpret the word विशिखा to mean “path, road.” (This sense is not common in Sanskrit literature (Meulenbeld, 1999, 1A 351-352; 1B, 323 n102) although it is known to lexicographers and also in Pāli (Vinayapiṭaka, Jātaka) and in Sinhalese (Turner, 1966, #11937). See also SS 3.10.9 for <em>viśikhāntaram</em> “interior of the road,” i.e., vaginal passage. The lexeme <em>śikhā</em> is a loan word in Sanskrit (Lubotsky, 2001, 305).)</p> <p>The fourth passage of the chapter, describes how a physician takes note of omens on the way to a patient’s home, and then how he diagnoses the patient:</p> <blockquote> <p>Then he should approach the house of the sick person according to the favourableness of the messenger, the reason given, omens, and good-luck signs. After sitting down, he should have a good look at the sick person, he should palpate them and interrogate them. Diseases are mostly understandable through these three means of gaining knowledge. That is what some people say, but it is not correct. There are six means of gaining knowledge about diseases, i.e., by the five senses, hearing etc., and by interrogation.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>दूतनिमित्तशकुनमङ्गलानुलोम्येनातुरगृहमभिगम्य, उपविश्य, आतुरमभिपश्येत्स्पृशेत्पृच्छेच्च; त्रिभिरेतैर्विज्ञानोपायै रोगाः प्रायशो वेदितव्या इत्येके; तत्तु न सम्यक्, षड्विधो हि रोगाणां विज्ञानोपायः, तद्यथा — पञ्चभिः श्रोत्रादिभिः प्रश्नेन चेति ।। ४ ।।| — (Ācārya, 1938, 43)</p> </blockquote> <p>As we see, the text first proposes a three-part method of diagnosis and then immediately distances itself from that statement and provides a different six-part procedure. One has the sense of hearing two voices.</p> <p>Who were the “some people” being referred to? The three-part diagnostic procedure is found in the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em> (Ca.ci.25.22 (Ācārya, 1938, 592)) . For that reason, this passage has been taken as evidence that the authors of the Suśrutasaṃhitā knew the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em> and were responding to it (Meulenbeld, 1999, 1A351-352). This is one of the pieces of evidence that is used to argue that the Suśrutasaṃhitā is chronologically later than the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em>.</p> <p>In the Nepalese version of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>, however, the passage is much simpler and omits this second, distancing, voice:</p> <blockquote> <p>Then, arriving at the house of the sick person according to the favourableness of the messenger, the reason given, omens, and good-luck signs, he should sit down. Then, he should have a good look at the sick person, he should palpate them and interrogate them. Through these three means of gaining knowledge it can be known whether life will be long or life will be short.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>ततो दूतनिमित्तशकुनमङ्गलानुलोम्येनातुरगृहमागम्योपविश्यातुरमभिपश्येत्स्पृशेच्च त्रिभिरेतैर्विज्ञानोपायैः दीर्घमायुषोल्पायुषो वेदितव्यः।</p> </blockquote> <p>Thus, the passage referring to the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em> is absent.</p> <p>Luckily, for this part of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em>, the learned commentary of Cakrapāṇidatta (fl. 1075) survives. It was edited and published in 1939 by Yādavaśarman T. Ācārya. Commenting on the passage, Ācārya stated that this extra passage was not known to Cakrapāṇidatta (Ācārya &amp; Śarman, 1939, 77, n.2: अयं पाठश्च चक्रासंगतः). Thus, we can say that it was added to the text of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> some time between the oldest Nepalese manuscript (878 CE) and Cakrapāṇidatta’s time, i.e., the eleventh century.</p> <p>The fact that this reference to the <em>Carakasaṃhitā</em> is not present in the early Nepalese version of the <em>Suśrutasaṃhitā</em> means that this argument about the <em>Carakasaṃhitā‘s</em> chronological priority cannot be sustained.</p> <h3 id="references">References</h3> <ul> <li>Ācārya, Yādavaśarman Trivikrama, ed. 1938. <em>सुश्रुतसंहिता, सुश्रुतेन विरचिता, वैद्यवरश्रीडल्हणाचार्यविरचितया निबन्धसंग्रहाख्यव्याख्यया समुल्लसिता, आचार्योपाह्वेन त्रिविक्रमात्मजेन यादवशर्मणा संशोधिता</em>. 3rd ed.

In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
