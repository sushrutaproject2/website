The _Compendium of Suśruta_ (_Suśrutasaṃhitā_) is a world classic of ancient
medicine, comparable in age and importance to the Greek Hippocratic Corpus and
the Chinese _Huangdi Neijing_. It is a substantial treatise of 186 chapters, written in the Sanskrit
language, that presents a systematic, scholarly form of medicine for diagnosing
and treating the many ailments that patients presented in South Asia two
thousand years ago. It is one of the founding treatises of Ayurveda, "The Knowledge of Life", the
indigenous medical system of South Asia, and it still informs indigenous
medical practice in India and Ayurvedic complementary and alternative
medical practice internationally. The _Compendium_ is perhaps most famous
amongst historians of medicine for its passages describing remarkable forms
of surgery some of which were witnessed by British surgeons in India in the
eighteenth century and subsequently formed the basis of certain types of
facial reconstruction as practised even today.

The _Compendium of Suśruta_ has a complicated and flawed history of
transmission and scribal corruption. The poor state of the text creates
challenges not only for the historian of medicine but also for patients who are
still treated by Ayurvedic doctors today who use _The Compendium_ as a living
medical textbook.

A stunning discovery in 2007 brought a new excitement and opportunities to
the subject. The Nepal-German Manuscript Cataloguing Project at Hamburg
University announced the discovery in the Kathmandu library of Kaiser
Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana (1892--1964), a former Prime Minister of Nepal,
of a palm-leaf manuscript of The Compendium of Suśruta that is reliably
datable to 878 CE. UNESCO has added this manuscript to the "Memory of the
World" register. This manuscript pushes our physical evidence for the treatise
back by a millennium. Detailed study of this thousand-year-old manuscript
during [The Suśruta Project](http://sushrutaproject.org) (2020-2024) revealed a much earlier stage of the work's
textual development and has placed our historical understanding of this Asian
medical classic on a new foundation.

This recent research has also revealed that at some time after the ninth
century, an aggressive campaign of editorial revision was applied to _The_
_Compendium_, pervasively altering the text and generating the vulgate
version that we know from printed editions today. The present project will
undertake detailed work based on much wider manuscript evidence in order
to map the textual evolution of this Classic in time and across the local
regions of South and SE Asia using traditional historical and philological
methods coupled with the methods of digital humanities. The
latter methods will allow fine control over the expected large volume of
differential data between the manuscripts, and enable the generation of
historical trees of relationship. The project will also transcribe and edit
previously unstudied medieval commentaries on _The Compendium_ including
the surviving fragments of commentaries by Jejjaṭa (fl. ca. 800), Candraṭa (fl.
ca. 900), and Gayadāsa (fl. ca. 1000). A strong hypothesis is that Candraṭa in
particular was a key contributor to the rewriting of _The Compendium,_ but this
needs to be tested through detailed study. None of these commentaries has
previously been published or studied.

The goal is to develop a fresh understanding of ancient South Asian medicine
based on the new evidence. We will be especially focussed on highlighting
the textual and doctrinal differences between _The Compendium_ as it existed
in 878 CE and the later vulgate version. Project outcomes will include critical
editions and translations of the main text and its commentaries, studies of
the transmission of scientific ideas within South Asia as well as to China and
South East Asia, and outreach to contemporary consumers of indigenous
medicine.
