Recent research has revealed that at some time after the ninth
century, an aggressive campaign of editorial revision was applied to _The_
_Compendium_, pervasively altering the text and ultimately generating the vulgate
version that we know from printed editions today. 

The project will transcribe and edit previously unstudied medieval commentaries on _The Compendium_ including the surviving fragments of commentaries by 

* Jejjaṭa (fl. ca. 800) ([PanditProject](https://panditproject.org/entity/40830/person)), 
* Candraṭa (fl. ca. 900) ([PanditProject](https://panditproject.org/entity/40937/person)), 
  and 
* Gayadāsa (fl. ca. 1000) ([PanditProject](https://panditproject.org/entity/108024/person)).

A strong hypothesis is that Candraṭa in particular was a key contributor to the rewriting of _The Compendium,_ but this needs to be tested through detailed study. None of these commentaries has previously been published or studied.
