- How many manuscripts of the _Compendium of Suśruta_ survive from ancient and pre-modern India and where are they? 
  
  At the present time, we think that there are over 200 surviving manuscripts that are called “_Suśrutasaṃhitā_” in various library catalogues and listings. However, most of these are not complete copies of the whole text. A small proportion, perhaps 20%, are dated.
  A list of the manuscripts of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* that have so far been identified can be found on the [PanditProject website](https://panditproject.org/entity/42004/work#manuscripts_manuscripts).
  
- Where are these manuscripts found? 

   They are kept in libraries all over India, with a few in Europe and one in the USA, as can be seen in this map:
