## Andrey Klebanov, Project Consultant

Dr. Andrey Klebanov studied Classical Indology and Tibetology in  Göttingen and Hamburg, where, in 2010, he received his Magister degree.  His final thesis was concerned with the study of an ancient āyurvedic  text, the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*, and its early transmission in Nepal.  His engagement with this topic led, among other things, to an  appointment at the NGMCP (Nepalese-German Manuscript Cataloguing  Project) office at Hamburg University, where he worked on preparing a  catalogue of Sanskrit manuscripts preserved at different libraries and  archives in Nepal. In 2012, Dr Klebanov enrolled in the doctoral  programme at Hamburg University and, during the preparation of his  thesis, spent a substantial amount of time studying and researching at  the EFEO (École française d'Extrême-Orient) centre in Pondicherry,  India. In his doctoral dissertation, completed in early 2017 and  published online, Dr. Klebanov turned his attention to the commentarial  literature on Sanskrit belles-lettres and studied several commentaries  on a classic work of Sanskrit poetry, the *Kirātārjunīya* by Bhāravi. During this time, Dr. Klebanov became invested in the study of Indian scholastic traditions, mainly those of *vyākaraṇa* (grammar) and *alaṃkāraśāstra* (poetics), which became the main focus of his subsequent teaching and  research. From 2016 until 2021, he was appointed a senior lecturer at  the Graduate School of Letters at Kyoto University in Japan. There, he  taught graduate and post-graduate students specialising in Classical  Indology, Buddhist Studies, Transcultural Studies and other related  fields.
