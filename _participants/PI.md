## Dominik Wujastyk, Principal Investigator

I have undergraduate degrees in Physics (Imperial College, London, 1974) and Sanskrit (University of Oxford, 1978), and a DPhil in Sanskrit specializing in Sanskrit grammar (University of Oxford, 1982). My doctoral studies were partly carried out at the Centre for the Advanced Study of Sanskrit at the University of Pune, India. My teachers in Oxford were Thomas Burrow, Alexis Sanderson, Richard Gombrich and Bimal Krishna Matilal (DPhil supervisor) and, in India, Shivram Dattatray Joshi, Venkatesh Laxman Joshi, Vaman Balkrishna Bhagavat, and Saroja Bhate. For many years I worked at the Wellcome Institute where I catalogued Sanskrit and Prakrit manuscripts and researched and taught the history of science and medicine in early India and later at the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at University College London where I held a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellowship for seven years.  I held a visiting scholarship at Harvard, 1987-1988, visiting lectureships at the Universities of Helsinki, Zürich, and Texas (Austin), and a Gonda Fellowship at the IIAS in Leiden.  I held a Research Fellowship at the University of Vienna (2009--2014).  From 2015-2024 I held the Singhmar Chair in Classical Indian Polity and Society in the Department of History, Classics, and Religion at the University of Alberta in Canada, where I am currently Professor Emeritus.
