The great Sanskrit scholar Yādavaśarman Trivikrama Ācārya edited three editions of *The Compendium of Suśruta* (*Suśrutasaṃhitā*) {% cite chak-2018a%}.  
They were published in 1915, 1931 and 1938 {% cite susr-1915 susr-1931 susr-1938 %}.  These editions, including the manuscripts Ācārya used, were discussed by Wujastyk et al. {% cite wuja-2023 -A -L chapter -l 3 %}. 

The Suśruta Project has been using an etext transcription of the 1938 edition, typed and generously made public by Tsutomu Yamashita and Yasutaka Muroya in 2014.  Because of the limited availability of text editions in Japan at the time, this etext used the 1931 edition for the sūtrasthāna and śārīrasthāna parts of the text.  The Suśruta Project 2.0 is currently inputting these parts from the 1938 edition, so that the etext will represent the 1938 edition in a unified way.

A side-effect of this work means that we are gaining the possibility of comparing the changes that Ācārya made between his 1931 and 1938 editions.  As an example, [here is the 1931 edition of the *Compendium* with the apparatus showing the changes that Ācārya made for his 1938 edition](https://saktumiva.org/wiki/wujastyk/susrutasamhita/03-su.sa/03-za-vulgate-1931?upama_ver=i4l46viq17).

## When should I get married?

If you scroll to passage 10.53 in the śārīrasthāna, where the care of children is being described, you will find a statement advising a young man of 25 years about whom to marry.  In the 1915 and 1931 editions, the passage reads :

> अथास्मै पञ्चविंशतिवर्षाय द्वादशवर्षां पत्नीमावहेत्पित्र्यधर्मार्थकामप्रजाः प्राप्स्यतीति॥ 
>
> Then, a man of twenty-five should take a wife of twelve so that he may obtain children for the sake of ancestral duty, wealth, and pleasure.
>
> --- Suśrutasaṃhitā Śārīrasthāna 10.53 {% cite susr-1931 -l 337 %}

But in the 1938 edition, Ācārya emended the passage to read "a wife of sixteen."  Viewed as an important social injunction, this is a major change.

In his footnote on this change {% cite susr-1938 -l 392 %}, Ācārya noted that on this point he was adopting the reading of the "palm leaf manuscript" (*षोडशवर्षां इति ता। पुस्तके पठ्यते)* and that the other manuscripts he examined read "twelve-year-old"  (*इतीतरेषु हस्तलिखितपुस्तकेषु*).  The palm leaf manuscript he refers to is MS Kathmandu NAK 5-333 (siglum H), and it does indeed read *षोडशवर्षाम्* “sixteen” (scribal folio 197r, line 2, image dscn3174 fol196.jpg ).

(As a footnote to a footnote, Ācārya made a typo in his 1938 edition: he printed *ṣoḍaṣadaśavarṣāṃ*; that this was just a typo is proven by his footnote, where he says "ṣoḍaśavarṣāṃ" {% cite susr-1938 -l 392 %}.)

The small details of philology and textual criticism can make a large difference to the meaning of a text that has real social impact both for our understanding of the past and for custom in India today.  Child marriage is still prevalent in India, although its frequency has been falling since the 1981 census due to modernization, legal and political action and social activism.
