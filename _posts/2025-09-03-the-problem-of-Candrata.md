# Candraṭa

Almost exactly a year ago, in a [blog post of 12 September 2024](https://sushrutaproject.org/2024/09/12/candrata/), we wrote about several manuscripts of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* that end with the verse,

>sauśrute caṃdraṭeneha bhiṣakṭīsaṭasūnunā /
pāṭhaśuddhiḥ kṛtā tantre ṭīkām ālokya jaijjaṭīṃ //

>The correction of readings (pāṭhaśuddhi) in the treatise of Suśruta was done by Candraṭa the son of the doctor Tīsaṭa, after studying the commentary of Jejjaṭa.

This verse has led some cataloguers like Eggeling to suggest that there exists a commentary by Candraṭa called the *Suśrutapāṭhaśuddhi*. 

We are beginning the work of examining the MSS that apparently contains this work, but the suspicion is growing that in fact Candraṭa did not write a separate work with this title.  Rather, he produced a *version* of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* that specifically adhered to the opinions of the commentator Jejjaṭa. The manuscripts we are seeing with the verse cited above are the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*, not some commentary on it. 

This would cast Candraṭa as a scholar who produced a new version of the whole Suśrutasaṃhitā, one that specifically accepted the readings of the earlier commentator Jejjaṭa. 

The commentator Ḍalhaṇa does not mention Candraṭa's name anywhere in his extensive commentary.   He is elsewhere not shy about citing predecessors, so we deduce that he was not aware of Candraṭa’s work.

At present, this is a hypothesis, and our project members are discussing the issue and thinking of ways to test the hypothesis.
