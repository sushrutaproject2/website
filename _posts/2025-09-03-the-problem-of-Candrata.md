# Candraṭa

Almost exactly a year ago, in a [blog post of 12 September 2024](https://sushrutaproject.org/2024/09/12/candrata/), we wrote about several manuscripts of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* that end with the verse,

>सौश्रुते चंद्रटेनेह भिषक्टीसटसूनुना |
पाठशुद्धिः कृता तन्त्रे टीकाम् आलोक्य जैज्जटीं  ||

>The correction of readings (pāṭhaśuddhi) in the treatise of Suśruta was done by Candraṭa the son of the doctor Tīsaṭa, after studying the commentary of Jejjaṭa.

Eggeling, for example, characterised a manuscript with this statement as follows {% cite egge-1887  -l 928a %}: 

>  "Portions of the *Sauśrutīya Āyurvedaśāstra* in Candraṭa's revision of the text made after Jaijjaṭa's (Jaiyyaṭa's) commentary.  Whether the explanatory notes added above and below the text belong to Jaijjaṭa's commentary does not appear" 

Some scholars have suggested that this verse describes an actual commentary or independent work of text-criticism by Candraṭa called the *Suśrutapāṭhaśuddhi* {% cite meul-hist -l 2A: 123 %}.	

We are beginning the work of examining the MSS that apparently transmit Candraṭa's this work, but the suspicion is growing that in fact Candraṭa did not write a *separate work* with this title.  Rather, he produced a *version* of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā* that specifically adhered to the opinions of the commentator Jejjaṭa. The manuscripts we are seeing with the verse cited above are the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*, not some commentary on it. 

This would cast Candraṭa as a scholar who produced a new version of the whole Suśrutasaṃhitā, one that specifically accepted the readings of the earlier commentator Jejjaṭa. 

The commentator Ḍalhaṇa does not mention Candraṭa's name anywhere in his extensive commentary.   He is elsewhere not shy about citing predecessors, so we deduce that he was not aware of Candraṭa’s work.

At present, this is a hypothesis, and our project members are discussing the issue and thinking of ways to test the hypothesis.
