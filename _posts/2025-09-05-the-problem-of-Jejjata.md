## Jejjaṭa

Related to the the problem of Candraṭa, we may note that manuscripts containing the "Candraṭa verse" that ends, "... आलोक्य जैज्जटीं ||" have sometimes been misinterpreted as containing a commentary by Jejjaṭa.  This is the case, for example, with MS Bikaner Anup 4391, that was reported in this way in NCC {% cite ncc -A -l 7: 317 %}.  This led Meulenbeld to assert the existence of a commentary by Jejjaṭa on the basis of this manuscript {% cite meul-hist -l 1B 506 n.360 %}.  In fact, MS Bikaner Anup 4391 is the text of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*, with the Candraṭa verse in the colophon.   It is likely that this is the same case for MS London IOLR Taylor 1842: this is currently being investigated. 

MSS currently known to have the Candraṭa verse:

*  [MS Bikaner Anup 4391](https://panditproject.org/entity/108211/manuscript)
*  [MS London IOLR Taylor 1842](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/108178/manuscript)
*  [MS Kurukṣetra Jawaharlal Nehru Library 19786](https://www.panditproject.org/entity/113349/manuscript), f. 78v

### Secondary citations?

There are numerous statements in the secondary literature asserting that commentators cite Jejjaṭa's commentary on the Suśrutasaṃhitā.  For example, the NCC (idem) names Hemādri, Vijayarakṣita, Ṭoḍarānanda, Nāganātha, and Rūpanayana, to  which Meulenbeld adds Ḍalhaṇa, Gayadāsa and Niścalakara  (ibid, v. 1A, p. 385).  Some of these may indeed be concrete evidence for a commentary on the Suśrutasaṃhitā by Jejjaṭa.  They need to be studied individually, especially those of Ḍalhaṇa and Niścalakara.  However, those that I have examined from Hemādri on the Aṣṭāṅgasaṅgraha, are from Jejjaṭa on the *Carakasaṃhitā*, not the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*.
