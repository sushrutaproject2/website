Work has begun in earnest on the task of collecting more digital copies of manuscripts of the *Suśrutasaṃhitā*.  Currently, the project is seeking copies of manuscripts from the following institutions:

* The Asiatic Society of Bengal, in Kolkata, 
* The Calcutta Sanskrit College and University, in Kolkata
*  The Saraswati Bhavan Library, Vārāṇasī
* The Nāgarī Prachārinī Sabhā, Vārāṇasī
* The Vārāṇasī Sanskrit College Library (probably an obsolete reference)

There are descriptive entries for the manuscripts at each of these institutions at [PanditProject](https://panditproject.org/entity/42004/work) (under "manuscripts").   These listing were updated yesterday with new individual entries for several manuscripts at the Calcutta Sanskrit College that had formerly been grouped in single entries.
